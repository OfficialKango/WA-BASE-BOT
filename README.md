# WA Base Bot

A modular WhatsApp bot built using Node.js and Baileys — designed as the foundation for my YouTube tutorial series.  
With this base, you can easily add new commands every day and build your own full-featured WhatsApp bot from scratch.

💡 Features:
- Dynamic plugin system (just add .js command files)
- Auto reload (no restart needed)
- Owner & admin permissions
- Organized categories
- System tools and media commands
- Beginner-friendly code for learning

Each episode adds 1–2 new commands so you can follow along and grow your bot step by step — even if you don’t know how to code.
